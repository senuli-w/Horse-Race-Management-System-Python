<h1>Horse Race Management System - Python Application</h1>
<p>This repository contains a Python-based horse race management system with a command-line interface (CLI). The system allows users to manage and track horse race events, including adding, updating, deleting, and selecting horses for races. It also includes functionality for saving and retrieving horse information from a text file.</p>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>

        <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Input validation is implemented to ensure accurate data entry for Horse IDs, Group allocation, and other fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Selection:</strong> Randomly selects horses from different groups (A, B, C, D) for the final round, ensuring fair competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Race Simulation:</strong> Simulates a horse race and randomly generates finishing times, determining the top three winners.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Horse details can be saved to a text file, enabling data persistence and retrieval across sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Tabular Visualization:</strong> Uses the <code>tabulate</code> library to display horse details and race results in a well-formatted table.</li>
    </ul>
